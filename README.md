## When I'm not at work, I'm ...:
* ... preparing for my Cisco CCNP and AWS SAP-C02 certifications to prove what I know
* ... I'm automating, securing and monitoring my smart home using HomeAssistant, Zigbee, MQTT, Pihole and Mikrotik 
* ... using my Canon 90D for it's true purpose: taking hundreds of photos of my toddler drawing on his tshirt 
* ... desperately trying to keep up with my GoodReads goal for the year
